            You Don’t Need Much… to be happy.  If you are not happy right now, you probably won’t be later either.  You should always have dreams and desires. Although happiness can come from fulfilled dreams, it is not a guarantee.  Your journey of dreaming and working towards those dreams should also be satisfying and an immense source of happiness.  If you are reading this blog right now it means you have access to a computer or smart phone with internet. You have healthy eyes to see this and some level of education to understand this content.  Deliberate and genuine gratitude for what you have right now and right here is the key to everlasting joy in the pursuit of happiness.

            My name is Ranjit. I have started this blog to share my thoughts on how you truly don’t need much for everything – from staying healthy, learning, saving money to taking good photos. I am not good at any of the above listed things but I have some information gathered through various sources over the past many years and would love to share them and also learn more about it from feedback I hope to get from you guys. Thanks
