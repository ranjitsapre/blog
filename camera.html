            If you search on google – “Should I buy a DSLR” or “Do I really need a new camera” – the result will be a lot of blogs and articles explaining how any new camera will not dramatically improve your photos or your photography. Most of those blogs will be written by professional photographers or professional photography trainers. In other words – people way more qualified than me on the subject. So I will not repeat the same by going into those technical details. However, because a photo is worth a 1000 words, I have posted this photograph.

            This was shot with an iPhone 4 (yes, I still have it and it works great even today) during one of my work trip to Israel. The experience of watching people float in the Dead Sea was amazing. I am not claiming that this is a great photo, but it does have a ‘wow’ factor in it.  I believe, as hobby photographers that is what we are looking for. While there were many friends who said they loved the photo, there was a considerable number who were only interested in which camera I used to take the shot. An expensive pen is not going to improve your hand writing — same applies to photography too.

            Irrespective of what camera you are using, the composition or design is the most important factor in creating a successful photograph. Developing the ability to see the possibility of a strong image and then organizing the graphical elements into a compelling composition, is the one skill that will enable you to take stunning photographs with whatever equipment is in your hand. My mentor and companion in my journey of understanding composition was the book – The Photographer’s Eye by Michael Freeman.

            Few years ago, I would have said that you need to understand ASI (Aperture, shutter-speed, ISO) — the three cornerstones of photography.  However, today the phone camera as well as the ‘auto’ mode of most cameras is so advanced and intelligent that you can spend all your life knowing nothing about ASI and still manage to take tons of great photos.  At the same time, I also hope that at some point you would want to go on the next level of photography where understanding ASI will become critical.  When that time comes, I highly recommend Bryan Peterson’s – Understanding Exposure.

            Just after the first three chapters my photography was transformed. No book will create fantastic photos just by reading it. You need to be willing to experiment a little with what the camera can do. Bryan Peterson does an amazing job of challenging the novice photographer, getting them out of their comfort zone and thinking about the technical capabilities of these very complex pieces of equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Read these and other books and then make sure you take photos with your camera. I see people reading, buying photo gear, reading more, researching more about cameras and lenses and then buying more. You need to get out and take photos with whatever camera you own right now – at least 500 photos a month. That is the only way to improve your skills.

          <h2 class="tm-page-title">More important than a photograph</h2>
          <p>
          Even today when I look at that photo, I go back in time..feeling the cold sand, light cold breeze, the smell of the salty Dead sea water and the screams and laughter of people floating or losing their balance in water. Its a memory that will always stay with me. The memory of standing in the deepest hypersaline lake of the world, at the earth’s lowest elevation 430 m below sea level. The sun had just set creating a magical sky overlooking the sea. Do you know why all that is still so fresh in my mind? Because I did not let the picture-taking come in the way of me enjoying the experience. It was only when it was time to go that I quickly snapped a picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel it is important to point this out — photos do not even come close to the pleasures of real experience. It is disturbing to see people seeing places only through their lenses while missing out on actual experience and then moving on to the next picturesque spot.
        </p>
        <p>Wish you luck. Happy shooting !!</p>
