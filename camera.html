            If you search on google – “Should I buy a DSLR” or “Do I really need a new camera” – the result will be a lot of blogs and articles explaining how any new camera will not dramatically improve your photos or your photography. Most of those blogs will be written by professional photographers or professional photography trainers. In other words – people way more qualified than me on the subject. So I will not repeat the same by going into those technical details. However, because a photo is worth a 1000 words, I have posted this photograph.

            This was shot with an iPhone 4 (yes, I still have it and it works great even today) during one of my work trip to Israel. The experience of watching people float in the Dead Sea was amazing. I am not claiming that this is a great photo, but it does have a ‘wow’ factor in it.  I believe, as hobby photographers that is what we are looking for. While there were many friends who said they loved the photo, there was a considerable number who were only interested in which camera I used to take the shot. An expensive pen is not going to improve your hand writing — same applies to photography too.

            Irrespective of what camera you are using, the composition or design is the most important factor in creating a successful photograph. Developing the ability to see the possibility of a strong image and then organizing the graphical elements into a compelling composition, is the one skill that will enable you to take stunning photographs with whatever equipment is in your hand. My mentor and companion in my journey of understanding composition was the book – The Photographer’s Eye by Michael Freeman.
